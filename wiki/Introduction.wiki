=== Summary ===

Slinker is an attempt to capture the best way to generate slitherlink-type puzzles. Slitherlink is probably a trademark of Nicoli ([http://www.nicoli.co.jp nicoli.co.jp]) who invented the puzzle, so go to them if you want to buy genuine quality puzzles.

If you have any use for Slinker, please just take it all and enjoy. It's GPL'd simply to encourage this.

=== Platforms ===

Slinker can be compiled for any platform supporting [http://www.wxwidgets.org/ wxWidgets] and [http://www.cmake.org CMake] - including Linux, Windows and Mac. 

Slinker is available as source code, or as binaries for certain platforms.

=== Status ===

An early alpha of Slinker is available. You can:
  * create and solve puzzles using a set of rules
  * export puzzles as a Loopy string
  * compute more rules, if `SlinkerGrid::FindNewRules()` makes sense to you

=== Future work ===

  * Solver should be able to offer hints when you get stuck, by pointing out where a rule can apply.
  * Puzzle creation should be faster - can we derive 'number removal' rules that tell us which numbers can be removed for a given local situation, given a set of solving rules?
  * Puzzles should make more use of the harder rules - rather than removing numbers at random, can we remove those that leave the puzzle only solvable using more complex rules?
  * Export as full Loopy format.
  * Import a Loopy puzzle and attempt to solve it given a ruleset.
